A responsive navbar created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The navbar is designed to adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Key features include:

HTML Structure: Semantic tags (<nav>, <ul>, <li>, <a>) for a clean and accessible layout.
CSS Styling: Flexbox or Grid layout for alignment, media queries for responsiveness, and hover effects for better interactivity.
JavaScript Functionality: A toggleable hamburger menu for smaller screens, smooth animations for menu transitions, and event listeners for user interactions.
The navbar displays horizontally on larger screens and collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile, offering a compact, user-friendly navigation solution. Fully customizable and built with accessibility in mind.
